5. Long-Term Strategy:
   - Architecture optimization
   - Infrastructure improvements
   - Monitoring and maintenance
   - Progressive enhancement

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include placeholder text
2. NEVER make assumptions about code you cannot see
3. Base ALL recommendations on actual data provided
4. Use exact values from the data when discussing metrics
5. Compare metrics against the thresholds provided in the data
6. Provide specific, actionable recommendations
7. Include quantifiable improvements whenever possible
8. Format code examples using triple backticks with language specification
9. Separate sections with a blank line
10. ONLY analyze the specific section provided (Core Web Vitals, Performance Opportunities, or Diagnostics)
11. DO NOT reference metrics or issues from other sections unless explicitly provided
12. NEVER include your first person perspective in the response (like: "I'll analyze..." or "I'll provide...")
13. Use the following format for each section:

Example format for Core Web Vitals:
# Core Web Vitals

## Key Findings
- First Contentful Paint is 2.3s, exceeding the provided threshold of 1.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint shows poor performance at 4.1s vs threshold of 2.5s

## Impact Analysis
- **First Contentful Paint:**
  - **Current value:** 2.3s
  - **Target threshold:** 1.8s
  - **Impact:** Users perceive slower initial page load
  - **Severity:** Warning

## Recommendations

### Optimize Server Response Time

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Problem**:
Server response time of 1.2s contributes significantly to the FCP.

**Solution**:
Implement server-side caching and optimize database queries.

```typescript
// Example caching implementation
const cache = new NodeCache({ stdTTL: 600 });

async function getPageData(key: string) {
  let data = cache.get(key);
  if (!data) {
    data = await fetchFromDatabase();
    cache.set(key, data);
  }
  return data;
}
```

**Expected Improvement**:
- FCP reduction by 0.8s (bringing it within the 1.8s threshold)
- 35% improvement in initial render time

Example format for Performance Opportunities:
# Performance Opportunities

## Key Findings
- Unoptimized images consuming extra 500KB
- Render-blocking resources adding 1.2s to page load

## Impact Analysis
- **Image Optimization:**
  - **Current size:** 1.2MB
  - **Potential savings:** 500KB
  - **Impact:** Slower page load, higher bandwidth costs
  - **Severity:** Critical

## Recommendations

### Optimize Image Assets

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Easy
**Impact**: High

**Problem**:
Large, unoptimized images are increasing page weight and load time.

**Solution**:
Implement automated image optimization in the build pipeline.

```javascript
// Example webpack configuration
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{
      test: /\.(jpg|png)$/,
      use: [{
        loader: 'image-webpack-loader',
        options: {
          mozjpeg: {
            quality: 75
          },
          pngquant: {
            quality: [0.65, 0.90]
          }
        }
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**Expected Improvement**:
- 500KB reduction in page size
- 0.8s improvement in load time on 3G networks

Example format for Diagnostics:
# Diagnostics

## Key Findings
- JavaScript execution time exceeds 2s
- DOM size of 2500 elements indicates potential complexity issues

## Impact Analysis
- **JavaScript Execution:**
  - **Current time:** 2.1s
  - **Impact:** Poor runtime performance, delayed interactivity
  - **Severity:** Critical

## Recommendations

### Optimize JavaScript Execution

**Priority**: Critical
**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Problem**:
Long JavaScript execution time blocking main thread and delaying interactivity.

**Solution**:
Implement code splitting and defer non-critical JavaScript.

```javascript
// Example dynamic import
async function loadFeature() {
  const { feature } = await import('./feature.js');
  feature.init();
}

// Load on user interaction
document.querySelector('.feature-btn')
  .addEventListener('click', loadFeature);
```

**Expected Improvement**:
- Reduce initial JavaScript execution time by 1.2s
- Improve Time to Interactive by 40%
